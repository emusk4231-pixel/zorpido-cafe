   env\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies

Notes

- This repository currently has no remote. To upload to GitHub provide a repository URL (HTTPS or SSH) or install and authenticate GitHub CLI (`gh`).
- If you want me to create the remote and push, tell me whether you prefer `HTTPS` or `SSH`, or provide the target repo URL.
